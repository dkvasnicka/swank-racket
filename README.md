============

NO LONGER MAINTAINED. Check out [https://github.com/mbal/swank-racket](https://github.com/mbal/swank-racket)

This is a Swank server for the [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) programming language (formerly PLT Scheme).

Swank server is what gives you an interactive Lisp / Scheme environment when working with SLIME (Emacs) or SLIMV (Vim).

### Status & limitations

- Basic evaluation and code completion works
- Only tested with Vim & SLIMV - Emacs & SLIME testers needed!

### Howto

Developed using Racket 6.0. I'm not aware of any 6.0-specific things in the code though, so it should run just fine with older versions. 

Run `racket server.rkt` to get the thing up and running.
